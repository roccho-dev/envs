# envs

`envs` holds public environment contracts, performs bounded provider projection, and returns a non-secret exact-SHA handoff.

- canonical branch: `proposals`
- retained compatibility branch: `main`
- accepted handoff identity: exact commit SHA

`main` remains available, but it has no independent meaning, direct changes, pull-request base, Environment effect, or handoff identity. When `main` is refreshed, its push-time check requires that revision to equal the then-current `proposals` revision. There is no continuous synchronization claim; `main` may be stale between explicit compatibility refreshes.

## Ownership

```text
contracts  = public meaning, IDs, relationships, required input names/types/lifecycles, and forbidden dependencies; never values
ciphertexts = versioned dev ciphertext only
adapters   = bounded envs-owned authoring/projection/readback
handoffs   = non-secret provider-effect receipts
checks     = executable repository and adapter specifications
```

`envs` does not own application runtime acceptance, independent consumer execution, generic deployment, UI meaning, live target observation, secret issuance, or target runtime state.

## Contracts

- `contracts/environments.jsonl` — stage and secret-plane ownership
- `contracts/bindings.jsonl` — application and capability bindings
- `contracts/targets.jsonl` — desired target meaning only
- `contracts/provider-consumer.jsonl` — envs/apps/ops responsibility and normal-path exclusions
- `handoffs/dev-jev-api.json` — real projection/readback PASS after exact-SHA non-secret handoff

## Environment inputs

`contracts/environments.jsonl` declares each GitHub Environment's `required_secrets` and `required_variables` by name, type, and lifecycle. The actual values live only in the GitHub Environment; the owner sets them there without a commit. Git never stores a value body: before any provider effect the adapter turns a missing or invalid required input RED, and turns RED when a live Variable value appears anywhere in the repository. The only exception is the recipient metadata that sops writes into `ciphertexts/dev-jev-api.sops.yaml`.

| Environment input | Kind | Type | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dev-authoring/JEV_API_KEY` | secret | opaque | one_shot_ingress |
| `dev-authoring/SOPS_AGE_RECIPIENTS` | variable | age_recipient_list | persistent |
| `dev-projection/SOPS_AGE_KEY` | secret | age_identity | persistent |
| `dev-projection/CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | secret | opaque | persistent |
| `dev-projection/CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | variable | cloudflare_account_id | persistent |
| `stg-projection/JEV_API_KEY` | secret | opaque | persistent |
| `stg-projection/CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | secret | opaque | persistent |
| `stg-projection/CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | variable | cloudflare_account_id | persistent |
| `prd-projection/JEV_API_KEY` | secret | opaque | persistent |
| `prd-projection/CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | secret | opaque | persistent |
| `prd-projection/CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | variable | cloudflare_account_id | persistent |

There are no stg or prd authoring Environments.

## Dev Jev flow

```text
dev-authoring/SOPS_AGE_RECIPIENTS
+ dev-authoring/JEV_API_KEY
→ author-dev-jev-api
→ ciphertext PR
→ merge to exact proposals SHA
→ dev-authoring/JEV_API_KEY may then be deleted by the owner (one-shot ingress);
  author stays RED until it is set again

ciphertext
+ dev-projection/SOPS_AGE_KEY, CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
→ project-dev-jev-api
→ provider effect + name-only readback
→ non-secret handoff PR (no account ID)
```

`envs` never deletes an Environment input; deleting the one-shot source is a separate owner effect.

## Effect toolchain

`flake.nix` and `flake.lock` define the only toolchain for authoring and projection: Python, SOPS, Wrangler, Git, and GitHub CLI from the locked nixpkgs input, plus the `envs-effect` entry.

```text
nix build .#effect-toolchain --no-update-lock-file   # before any secret is injected
envs-effect author | project                         # store paths only; no ambient PATH
```

The effect workflows realize the closure before the secret-bearing step and then run only its store paths. No Nix, npm, or other package resolution runs after secret injection. The entry carries a manifest of its exact tools and nixpkgs lock; before SOPS or Wrangler starts, the adapter turns RED when that manifest is absent, outside the Nix store, differs from the checked-out `flake.lock`, lacks a tool, or is not running on its own Python. The secret-free `check` workflow reconstructs the same flake output, executes `envs-effect toolchain`, and proves the missing and mismatched cases RED.

This is source and CI evidence only. It does not claim a real authoring or projection effect.

Normal apps/ops execution uses only target-native auth. It does not start or wait for envs, use envctl as a parent, decrypt SOPS, or receive an age identity.

## Checks

```text
python3 checks/repository.py
python3 checks/test_repository.py
python3 checks/test_jev_api.py
nix build .#effect-toolchain --no-update-lock-file   # check workflow, toolchain job
```

The repository oracle calculates accepted structure and state. Its tests deliberately create invalid states and require RED rather than repeating only happy-path execution.
